# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use Microsoft Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Script, which interacts with Excel using complex logic and reading cells, in order to collect specific data for stocks in the years 2017 and 2018 and in order to determine whether the specific stock (DQ) was worth investing in. The code was completed (greenstocks) in order to automate analyses that allows for reusage with different data and reduces the chances of accidents and errors. The code was then refactored (VBA Challenge) in order to improve on the efficiency of the original code.

### Background
* Steve just graduated with a finance degree and his parents are his first clients, They are currently investing in DAQO's stock. Steve is looking into DAQO's stock for his parents and is concerned about diversifying their funds and wants to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stock so he created a spreadsheet containing the stock data used for this analysis. Steve's parent want to know how actively SQ was traded in 2018. They believe that if a stock is traded often, then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock. If the daily volume for DQ is summed up then the yearly volume can be calculated and a rough idea is formed of how oftenthe stock gets traded

* Steve wants to know how well DQ performed in 2018, one way to measure that is calculate the yearly return for DQ, the yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning to the end of the year. Usage of loops and conditions and checking the conditions using logical (Boolean) operators are used in this project in order to create an efficient data analysis
